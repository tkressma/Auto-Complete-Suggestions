# Auto-Complete-Suggestions
This program produces auto-complete suggestions for the files in any specified directory. This is done by taking all of the file names in the directory, sorting them alphabetically, followed by putting them into a trie structure where words are linked based on their shared letters. The user inputs starting characters, to which the tree is recursively traversed, and the result(s) returned are the words that branched off of the users input/given starting character(s).
